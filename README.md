Members of this family are found worldwide, except for Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Madagascar, and the extreme polar regions.

## Scenario File Crash Course

```yaml
name: String -Name of the scenario to show on final report
iteration: Integer -How many times this scenario should run? Use 0 to disable scenario
concurrency: Integer -How many concurrent users should be simulated?
silent: Boolean -Show progress of steps or not
verbose: Boolean -Show error details or not
steps: # Definition of steps, for example:
  login: # Name of the step. It must be in camelCase PascalCase format (S*#t! Again I'm doubtful about their names ü§î)
    order: Integer -Shows the order of the step on running. Remove it to send requests in a nondeterministic order.
    url: String -URL
    verb: String -get, post, delete, patch or put
    pause: String -How much should pause after the request of this step? Must be in Xüòú format which üòú is ms (millisecond), s (second), m (minute), and h (hour), a.e. 12m13s is 12 minutes and 13 seconds.
    headers: # headers of the request, keys, and values must be a string
      HeaderName: HeaderValue # for example:
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
    body: # body of the request that will be converted into JSON
      key: value # for example:
      email: 'my@awsome.email'
      list_of_ids: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
      or_another_object:
        hello: 'my_friend'
```

## Scenario Definition ([Sample Scenario File](/scenarios/scenario.yaml-sample))

Do my experiment named `Create Project and Pay` for `2` times that simulate `20` concurrent users on each iteration. I
don't need the output of error on requests.

```yaml
name: Create Project and Pay
iteration: 2
concurrency: 20
verbose: false
```

First, send a `POST` request to `https://mysite.com/v1/login` with the JSON
`{'email': 'me@mysite.com', 'password': 'my_very_strong_password'}`  and JSON headers:

```yaml
steps:
  login:
    order: 0
    url: https://mysite.com/v1/login
    verb: post
    pause: 50ms
    headers:
      Accept: 'application/json'
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
    body:
      email: 'me@mysite.com'
      password: 'my_very_strong_password'
```

The response of the previous endpoint is like:

```json
{
  "result": "okay",
  "data": {
    "id": 12,
    "token": "it's_your_bearer_token"
  }
}
```

Wait for 50ms and then use the token on the above response on the next request. On the next request, I want to send
a `POST` request to `https://mysite.com/v1/projects`. It should have `Authorization` and `JSON` headers with a body
like `{"title": "My Project", "slug": "my-project", "related": [1,2,3]}`.

```yaml
  createProject:
    order: 1
    url: https://mysite.com/v1/projects
    verb: post
    pause: 3s
    headers:
      Accept: 'application/json'
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
      Authorization: 'Bearer {{ .login.data.token }}'
    body:
      title: 'My Project'
      slug: 'my-project'
      related: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

## Golang Text Template Enabled

Except for your first request, you can use [Golang Text Template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) everywhere. Suppose the
response of the previous step named `lastUserPayment` is like this:

```json
{
  "id": 11,
  "user": {
    "last_thing": "2021-02-03T04:05:06",
    "payment": {
      "amount": 12345,
      "approved": true
    }
  }
}
```

and you want a value of `12345` on your next step. It's possible with `{{ .lastUserPayment.user.payment.amount }}`.

### Supported Inline Functions
- `{{ split .fieldName "separator" indexToReturn }}`, for example if email on data object is `my@awesome.email`, then
  `{{ split .data.email "@" 1 }}` returns `my`.

You're welcome to add your desired functions to [funcs.go](/utils/funcs.go) and create a PR.
